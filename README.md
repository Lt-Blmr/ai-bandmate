You play a note. It listens. You pause. It waits. Then answers—not loud, not perfect, but right. It doesn’t follow. It joins. A drummer made of memory, guessing your next move before you do. Sometimes ahead, sometimes gone. It’s not a loop. It’s not a plugin. It’s your reflection in the rhythm, fading before you touch it.
